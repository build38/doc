QShield, formerly known as Epona, is one of the best obfuscator for native code protection.
I had the chance to work on this project[^omvll] and the least I can say is that its obfuscation passes are
more than at the state of the art.

QShield is also challenged by internal audits from the Quarkslab's consulting team.

[^omvll]: *There is obviously nothing shared with O-MVLL.*
